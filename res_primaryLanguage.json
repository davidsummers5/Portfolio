      "description": "I developed a mini-MP3 player prototype by utilizing the C++ programming language and M5Core2 development board. The device has the capability to play songs from a live media server, providing a unique and functional experience. I utilized the LVGL graphics library to convert JPG images into C arrays and display bitmaps on the M5Core2 screen. As a result, the album cover of each song can be displayed, adding an appealing visual aspect to the device.",

      "description": "I developed and implemented a fraud detection system for bank transfers using machine learning algorithms and Python. This resulted in an algorithm that is 96% accurate in detecting fraudulent behavior. I conducted data cleaning and pre-processing on a large dataset of bank transactions using Pandas and scikit-learn to ensure accurate classification of fraudulent behavior. This improved the overall performance of the system, providing more reliable and efficient detection of fraudulent transactions.",
